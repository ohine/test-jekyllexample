So you want to get started with Jekyll? 

Well, you've come to the right place. This post will walk you through the steps to get you going if you're new to Jekyll and want to get it up and running with a clean instance.  
We recommend if you're brand new to Jekyll though you use our other instructions that utilize this site as a template for you to build your own site, complete with theme and sample content.  

## Get Started

First, you'll need to install Jekyll. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

## Create a New Site

Now that you have Jekyll installed, you can create a new site. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
jekyll new my-awesome-site
```

## Serve Your Site

Now that you have a site, you can serve it locally. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
cd my-awesome-site
jekyll serve
```

## Make Some Changes

Now that you have a site, you can make some changes. To do this, open the `_config.yml` file in your favorite text editor and make some changes.

## Commit Your Changes

Now that you have made some changes, you can commit them. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Made some changes"
```

## Push Your Changes

Now that you have committed your changes, you can push them. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
git push origin master
``` 

## Conclusion

And that's it! You've now got a Jekyll site up and running. You can now make some changes and push them to GitHub Pages.
